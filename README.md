# MedicalViewer

Medical visualization demonstration app.

Written in C#/.NET Core 3.1 using OpenTK.

Built in ~40 hours as part of my software programming portfolio.

Several classes (Camera.cs, Shader.cs, Texture.cs) adapted from [https://github.com/opentk/LearnOpenTK](LearnOpenTK) and (ObjLoader.cs) from [https://github.com/dabbertorres/ObjRenderer](ObjRenderer).
